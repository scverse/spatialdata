The CLI Interaction module.

This module provides command line interface (CLI) interactions for the SpatialData library, allowing users to perform
various operations through a terminal. Currently, it implements the "peek" function, which allows users to inspect
the contents of a SpatialData .zarr dataset. Additional CLI functionalities will be implemented in the future.

    Peek inside the SpatialData .zarr dataset.

    This function takes a path to a local or remote .zarr dataset, reads and prints

        The path to the .zarr dataset to be inspected.
    selection
        Optional, a list of keys (among images, labels, points, shapes, table) to load only a subset of the dataset.
