# Installation

`spatialdata` requires Python version >= 3.9 to run and the installation time requires a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.

## PyPI

Install `spatialdata` by running::

```bash
    pip install spatialdata
```

## Visualization and IO

The SpatialData ecosystem is designed to work with the following packages:

-   [spatialdata-io][]: `spatialdata` IO for common spatial omics technologies.
-   [spatialdata-plot][]: Static plotting library for `spatialdata`.
-   [napari-spatialdata][]: napari plugin for `spatialdata`.

They can be installed with:

```bash
pip install "spatialdata[extra]"
```

## Additional dependencies

To use the `PyTorch` dataloader in `spatialdata`, `torch` needs to be installed. This can be done with:

```bash
pip install "spatialdata[torch]"
```

## Installation on a M1/M2 (Apple Silicon) Mac

The framework supports the Apple Silicon architecture, but `napari-spatialdata` cannot be installed with `pip`, because `PyQt5` leads to an installation error.

Thus `pip install "spatialdata[extra]"` will not work (as it installs `napari-spatialdata`).

The solution is to pre-install `napari` via `conda` (which will install `PyQt5` correctly), and then install `napari-spatialdata` without the option `[extra]`.

This is what is done in the following commands, which perform a correct installation on a M1/M2 Mac.

```bash
mamba create -n my_env python==3.10 -y
conda activate my_env

mamba install -c conda-forge napari -y
pip install spatialdata spatialdata-io spatialdata-plot napari-spatialdata
```

## Development version

To install `spatialdata` from GitHub, run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/scverse/spatialdata
```

Alternative you can clone the repository (or a fork of it if you are contributing) and do an editable install with:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This is the reccommended way to install the package in case in which you want to contribute to the code. In this case, to subsequently update the package you can use `git pull`.

### A note on editable install

If you perform an editable install of `spatialdata` and then install `spatialdata-plot`, `spatialdata-io` or `napari-spatialdata`, they may automatically override the installation of `spatialdata` with the version from PyPI.

To check if this happened you can run

```
python -c "import spatialdata; print(spatialdata.__path__)"
```

if you get a path that contains `site-packages`, then your editable installation has been overridden and you need to reinstall the package by rerunning `pip install -e .` in the cloned `spatialdata` repo.
