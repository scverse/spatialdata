  abstract = {Scanpy is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell gene expression data. It includes methods for preprocessing, visualization, clustering, pseudotime and trajectory inference, differential expression testing, and simulation of gene regulatory networks. Its Python-based implementation efficiently deals with data sets of more than one million cells (https://github.com/theislab/Scanpy). Along with Scanpy, we present AnnData, a generic class for handling annotated data matrices (https://github.com/theislab/anndata).},

However, handling uni- and multi-modal spatial omics datasets remains a challenge owing to large volumes of data, heterogeneous data types and the lack of unified spatially-aware data structures. Here, we introduce SpatialData, a framework that establishes a unified and extensible multi-platform file-format, lazy representation of larger-than-memory data, transformations, and alignment to common coordinate systems. SpatialData facilitates spatial annotations and cross-modal aggregation and analysis, the utility of which is illustrated via multiple vignettes, including integrative analysis on a multi-modal Xenium and Visium breast cancer study.Competing Interest StatementJ.M. holds equity in Glencoe Software which builds products based on OME-NGFF.
